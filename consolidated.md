# Concept - Barnabasâ€™ Funerals

The faction of Planet A is desperate to find the heart. They recover
Barnabas' cloak and gauntlet and give it to ... daughter? who gives it
to granddaughter? not entirely sure here.

A funeral service should be held for Barnabas. Explore his civilization
and characters within it. Rumors. Political intrigue. Not sure what to
do with his daughter.

# Barnabasâ€™ Journey
## World Length

???

## Description

Barnabas forced to leave home. Journeys. Eventually lands on Daor.

Should cover why Barnabas had to leave.

Barnabas was an obstacle and so Barnabas was removed.

Barnabas was a hero to the people and a very important figure.

Barnabas was removed in a way that retained his legacy.

This would likely be in the form of an impossible mission.

# ðŸ˜›

#}

The garden is definitely cut in half. Would that necessarily cut the god in half? No. The god would be cut off from half of the garden though. This seed could be one that the god planted to protect the other side. This goes with the theme of "protection." The god would have used a considerable amount of power. There would then only be "one" sand planet.

If we look at two sand planets, one for each side, we then need to explore duality. There'd need to be two Nimhdus. Things would get a bit strange. This implies that the god has a will beyond the mechanism of simply planting seeds. This does not seem correct. The god is a mechanism. A natural thing. If a "special" seed was planted for the side it was cut off from it would have to be a natural defensive reaction, not a calculated one. It would continue to plant seeds until it vanished. This frames Nimhdu as a parasite.

What would make this god automatically send a seed to the side it was being cut off from? This seems like an extraordinary thing to happen so the god wouldn't react in this way. If we look back at the mutation then there are multiple sand planets. It doesn't make sense for them to mutate though as a result of the influence of the Daolin. Tying back to the cycle with the girl and the water fairy why would they need to maintain the planet? It is a fountain of creation. Their role doesn't make sense. If they are a defense mechanism for the planet itself that would make more sense. This would mean that the people in the vicinity would be connected to the seed. How would they know? Now we're getting into strange visions or some kind of religion around the seed. Some kind of prophecy.

It could very much be an arbitrary ritualistic thing. The girl shepherds the water fairy to the skies. That in and of itself is enough. This doesn't need to be tied to any gods. It is a good story just the way it is. Can introduce tragedy like she must sacrifice herself for something but that comes with a whole lot of problems that don't fit into the totality of the universe.

The water fairy would be laid in a very certain place. The girl would go to awaken it and bond with it as some rite of passage. Would bring it back and raise it. The girl would be born after the presence of the water fairy. The water fairy's presence in this place would mark that she was going to be born. The village would need to test children to find the one that was linked to the water fairy. Why is this particular tribe tied to the water fairy? If they are tied together then this tie is the result of the formation of this sand planet. For now I just know that the water fairy and the girl go on a journey to the skies. I don't know the backstory behind their relationship or why they are journeying yet.

The god would already be dead and the "godseed" planted before the maw. The filaments would naturally reach out to planets and connect them to the network? This godseed would be cannibalizing the universe. I don't know if I like this idea. I'm down to let the water fairy and girl be their own things.

# Trash Notes - God Seed questions

The skypeople would be those that studied the mystery of this planet and grew close to the seed?

Water fairies born every once and awhile to protect the seed from disaster?

Perhaps the planting of this seed tied a people to it? Or perhaps the skypeople came from the seed itself and one is chosen to awaken the water fairy? I don't know where I'm going with this now.

It doesn't make a lot of sense that the sand planets are a mutation. They are very much some kind of defense mechanism. The giant planting the seeds will eventually exhaust itself and vanish. Would this universe just persist as is? Would it eventually birth and become a new god as the seeds grow? Then the process is started anew?

Set this down for a week or two and go back to it and think it over again. I'm at a wall. Does everything need to be a cycle? Can the god simply vanish and the garden will remain as it is? The planets would continue to grow until their seeds are exhausted and then everything would die. This makes much more sense. It doesn't make sense to create a new god from the universe itself or the universe being a god. If anything you'd want a "special" seed that would birth a new god. The sandstreams of the special seed could be the filament forming the new god. It is growing far beyond the planet and spanning the entire universe. Reclaim the stale energy from the planets and all of those creations?

# Sandhorse

Draft

**Scale and General Description:**

- **Length:** Approximately 25-30 feet.
- **Body Shape:** Streamlined and elongated with a flexible neck and powerful limbs, built for steady, efficient sand-swimming with occasional bursts of speed.

**Head and Snout:**

- **Tapered Snout:** Narrow and elongated to streamline movement through the sand, suited for precise strikes at nearby prey or foraging.
- **Mixed Dentition:** Sharp front teeth ideal for catching medium-sized prey, while the broader back teeth are adapted for grinding tough desert vegetation.
- **Sensory Receptors:** Vibration-sensitive receptors along the snout allow it to detect both plant material and animal movement beneath the sand.

**Neck and Head Positioning:**

- **Flexible, Muscular Neck:** The long neck provides extended reach, allowing the creature to forage or lunge effectively while keeping its body steady. It also provides enough strength for short bursts of motion when lunging or evading.
- **Reptilian Nostrils:** Positioned near the tip of the snout, enabling efficient breathing when its head is above the sand and quick access to air when it surfaces.

**Body and Limb Structure:**

- **Paddle-Like Limbs for Efficient Travel:** The creature has four broad, paddle-like limbs designed for gliding across the sand at a steady pace, using rhythmic, wave-like motions that conserve energy for long distances. When necessary, these limbs can also provide a quick burst of speed.
- **Internal Muscular System for Smooth Sand Swimming:** Specialized muscles along its body create a steady, undulating motion, enabling the creature to move fluidly and efficiently through the sand.
- **Tail for Balance and Steering:** The muscular tail aids with steering and balance, particularly useful for direction changes during sand-swimming. It also provides stability for the rider and quick turns if needed.

**Behavior and Adaptations:**

- **Omnivorous Diet:** Primarily feeds on desert vegetation like fibrous shrubs and roots, supplemented with medium-sized animals and small reptiles when available. This mix ensures versatility and sustenance in the desert environment.
- **Adaptive Lunging Capability:** The creature can perform quick lunges, using its long neck to grab nearby prey or access hard-to-reach vegetation. This lunge adds versatility to its foraging and defensive repertoire.
- **Dual Travel Modes:**
    - **Surface Travel:** With its head, neck, and back above the sand, the creature travels at a stable, moderate pace, scanning for vegetation and potential prey while conserving energy.
    - **Full Sand Submersion:** When needing stealth or evasion, it can submerge fully, using its sand-swimming abilities to travel unnoticed or avoid predators. It holds its breath for extended periods when submerged, using sensory receptors to navigate and detect nearby threats or food sources.

**Mount Design for Rider:**

- **Single-Rider Saddle:** Positioned mid-back, the saddle is low-profile and crafted from durable desert leather, designed to contour with the creatureâ€™s dorsal ridge for minimal drag and optimal comfort.
- **Rider Positioning:** The rider sits in a semi-kneeling posture with legs bent backward, aligning naturally with the creatureâ€™s smooth, gliding motion. This setup offers stability during both surface travel and full sand submersion.
- **Hand Grips and Foot Anchors:** Leather hand grips and foot anchors provide the rider with secure balance, especially during directional changes or the creatureâ€™s occasional burst of speed.

# Skypeople Descendants

A hidden people who maintained a deep cultural connection to DÃ¤or's skies, though themselves many generations removed from the original skypeople civilization. Until their recent destruction, they lived in a secluded village preserving ancient knowledge and traditions, particularly their sacred relationship with water fairies that revolved around a complex cycle of worldstone, water fairy, and priestess.

## Cultural Heritage

- While not skypeople themselves, maintained stronger ties to sky traditions than surface dwellers
- Preserved crucial knowledge of safe routes through dangerous sky territories
- Maintained ancient methods of signaling that water fairies recognize and trust
- This trust relationship dates back to when skypeople first tamed water fairies
- Culture shaped by defining tragedy of descent from skies and subsequent persecution
- Entire cultural system organized around maintaining readiness for rare water fairy arrivals

## The Great Descent and Origin of Traditions

- Possessed a powerful worldstone from another world that enabled water fairies to fly at surface level
- This worldstone proved crucial during the exodus from the skies
- Their leader rode the first water fairy as catalyst, enabling the worldstone to protect the entire group's descent
- The leader's return journey with all the water fairies established the priestess tradition
- This return was necessary as the water fairies began falling ill on the surface
- This historic event created the eternal bond between descendants, water fairies, and the worldstone

## The Sacred Cycle

- The ancient worldstone remains at its historical location on a floating mountain
- Only releases in the presence of the water fairy's baby if it can serve as a catalyst
- Water fairies can only descend safely when their baby can serve as a catalyst
- No attempts are made without a catalyst baby - it would mean certain death
- One parent brings their baby down knowing:
    - They will wither and die on the surface within a few years
    - Their baby can survive until a priestess matures
    - They won't live to see their child return to the skies
    - Their mate will remain in the skies
- The worldstone returns to its mountain location with each priestess's final journey
- Each successful cycle represents the rare convergence of:
    - A water fairy baby capable of serving as a catalyst
    - The current generation's priestess reaching maturity
- This rarity explains the 100-200 year gaps between arrivals
- The water fairy population steadily declines because:
    - Only some babies can serve as catalysts
    - Each successful cycle requires splitting a pair
    - The population can at best remain stable, never grow

## The Priestess Legacy

- Priestess role passes through a hereditary line with particularly strong affinity for this type of worldstone
- This strong affinity is necessary to control such a potent worldstone
- One girl born per generation to carry on the legacy
- Training begins from early age, combining:
    - Practical knowledge of baby water fairy care
    - Navigation of safe sky routes
    - Spiritual traditions
    - Worldstone wielding techniques specific to their type of worldstone
    - Cultural preservation
- Each generation's priestess:
    - Maintains traditions whether chosen for journey or not
    - Helps train next generation
    - Maintains signaling traditions
    - Preserves route knowledge
- Water fairy baby serves as catalyst for priestess's worldstone wielding ability
- Priestess ultimately guides the mature water fairy back to the skies

## Cultural Structure

- Village elders maintain traditions between these rare, successful alignments
- Multiple generations live without seeing a water fairy
- Knowledge preserved despite most never experiencing traditions directly
- Creates a culture of:
    - Deep reverence for rare successes
    - Constant vigilance
    - Dedication to preservation
    - Hope despite uncertainty
- Every generation must maintain complete readiness

## Recent History and Legacy

- Collaborated with Barnabas to design a sanctuary in the skies
- Sanctuary intended to:
    - Protect water fairies from sand tornadoes
    - Create possibility for descendants to reclaim part of their ancestral home
    - Potentially create safer passages
    - Allow more water fairy babies to survive
- Village destroyed in Book 1 prologue
- Only the priestess survives, becoming:
    - Last carrier of their knowledge and traditions
    - Final link in irreplaceable chain
    - Guardian of ancient worldstone, the only one of its kind on Daor
    - Key to water fairy species survival

## Persecution

- Surface dwellers blamed their ancestors for the formation of deadly sand rivers
- Viewed as harbingers of doom
- Forced to maintain strict secrecy
- Centuries of persecution reduced their numbers
- Final destruction came from those seeking the water fairy

## **Could The Desire For The Water Fairy Be For Resources?**

An ambitious individual might have studied up on the legends of the water fairy and the skypeople. They may desire resources in the skies and to use the water fairy as a device of war. They'd likely have a lab. The mercenary group would be sent out with some devices from said lab to capture the water fairy and the girl. The girl knows the paths.

## Could the desire for the water fairy be for salvation?

Perhaps the people are on the brink. The rivers of sand are getting worse. Most believe that the skypeople control the rivers of sand with their sorcery. The emperor wants the remainder of the skypeople found and wiped out.

One officer says "I do not believe in such sorcery." They studied the ancient legends and view the water fairy as a bastion of hope. Maybe the people can use it and other water fairies to escape to the skies?

# The Age of Exploration

The question here is what is the origin of life on each planet? It'd be the heart, right? A form of arbitrary absent of will creationism might work well here.

How would ecosystems make sense then? *shrugs*. I thought it might be interesting for the "people" of this planet to have been settlers from long ago but I don't know if that works. Maybe most people came from one planet long, long ago in an age before Nimhdu's descent when people sailed the ocean en masse? An age of exploration? Mass settlements?

With Nimhdu's descent it would have been an age of darkness and loss. Maybe Barnabas' world is a fragment remaining from that long distant past? All these other worlds disconnected settlements, lost and forgotten, their peoples growing an affinity with the planets they inhabited. Some ideas :).

Update

Barnabas is not out to steal the heartstone. He doesn't have a device to do so. He settled on this planet since it is a planet of sand. It was part of studying the sandstreams to utilize their mystery to defeat Nimhdu.

When the heart is extracted it takes time to process the heart. The ship will be there for awhile while the planet falls apart. The trio go up to the ship and board it. They fight through and take the heart. Barnabas had been developing a heart container for a long time to hold hearts. They put it inside of that.

As they escape Barnabas has to stay behind. This is where he dies fighting off the generals.

Barnabas was sent on this mission that he could never hope to clear in order to "exile" him as he was an obstacle. (there may be a more interesting thing we can do instead, like an attempted assassination and Barnabas escapes never to return)

Barnabas did not develop the container now.

"The planet is gone but we can atleast keep the heart away from Nimhdu"

They will take control of the process and take the heart after it's contained.

The ship cannot shrink the heart. It can only contain it. The heart will stay very large. It is meant to transport the heart back where it can then be shrunken and contained in a much smaller vessel.

It would be Barnabas using his engineering capabilities to change the shipâ€™s process along with worldstone usage to shrink the heartstone. It causes the entire ship to blow.

It implies that water coalesces into central points in the air, leaving no moisture anywhere else. I like the idea of the gills but I think we need a more fantastical approach to make this idea work. It has been an open question how things on the surface get water. It seems like water draws together and the larger body continues to draw water.

Role of the Water Fairy and Priestess

Skypeople Descendants

History and Background:

Originally lived in the skies above DÃ¤or.

Dangerous sandstreams and sand tornadoes made the skies uninhabitable.

The skypeople descended to the surface, possibly using water fairies for the journey.

Their descendants now live on the surface, preserving their heritage and traditions.

Deep connection with the water fairy, central to their culture.

The village's role is to raise water fairies, which are very rare.

Barnabas

Background:

An elderly inventor and powerful worldstone wielder from Planet A.

Settled on DÃ¤or because it is a planet of sand.

His purpose is to study the sandstreams to utilize their mysteries to defeat Nimhdu.

He does not have a device to steal heartstones and is not attempting to do so.

Role in the Story:

An external enemy extracts the planet's heartstone.

The extraction process takes time, and the enemy ship remains near the planet while it begins to fall apart.

Barnabas, the priestess, and Nestharus decide to board the enemy ship to retrieve the heartstone.

They fight through the ship.

They take control of the process and take the heart after it's contained.

During their escape, Barnabas sacrifices himself by staying behind to fight off the generals, ensuring the others can escape.

Before his sacrifice, he remarks, "The planet is gone but we can at least keep the heart away from Nimhdu."

Barnabas was sent on this mission that he could never hope to complete, effectively exiling him because he was considered an obstacle by certain parties.

Alternatively, there may have been an attempted assassination from which Barnabas escapes, leading to his exile.

Water Fairy

A species from the skies; an aerial creature.

Translucent blue and teal tones.

Difficult to survive on the surface due to the need for a moisture-rich environment.

The only creature that can fly on the surface as an adult.

Acts as the only link between the surface and the skies.

Lifecycle and Role:

Water fairy babies are frail and cannot survive in the skies due to dangerous conditions.

Parents bring the baby water fairy to the surface to be raised by the skypeople descendants.

The village raises one water fairy at a time, making it a significant event.

Upon maturity, the water fairy returns to the skies, accompanied by the priestess.

Raising the water fairy is a sacred duty among the skypeople descendants.

Symbolizes a connection to their old home and heritage.

Associated with life after death and considered a divine creature.

Role and Responsibilities:

Primary caregiver and guardian of the water fairy.

Responsible for raising the water fairy until it is ready to return to the skies.

The journey is dangerous and possibly a one-way trip, implying significant sacrifice.

Holds an important position within the skypeople descendants' community.

Embodies the hopes and beliefs of her people.

Big Bad Guy

Identity and Motivation:

A high-ranking officer who does not believe in the common superstition that the skypeople descendants control the sand rivers through sorcery.

Has studied ancient legends and views the water fairy as a bastion of hope.

Believes that the water fairy could be used to escape to the skies or find salvation for the people.

Motivated by the worsening conditions on DÃ¤or and seeks a solution.

# How do people of a sandstream ship get down to the surface of a world?

Best idea I have so far is somehow warping the bubble to approach the surface. I do not like this idea whatsoever.

# How Does One Become A Worldstone Wielder On Daor?

If exploring an examination to become a worldstone wielder then there can be problems.

An exam in the context of Hunter x Hunter is run by the hunter's association. On a planet that doesn't necessarily make sense. On Daor with multiple kingdoms and city-states that especially doesn't make sense.

# How Do Bubbles And Sandstreams Interact With Daolin?

Do the "bubbles" from the heartstones keep Nimhdu and other Daolin away? What about the sand? Maybe it's a zone of influence over the universe?
