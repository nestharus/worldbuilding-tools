giant blue man notes

1. this being is influenced by atheism and nihilism
2. this being is an abstract entity defined by will
3. shifting perspective is interpreting a space in multiple ways. consider using instruments to see different aspects of our universe. same space, different perspective
4. the space is highly abstract and is interpreted through a symbolic representation of that space
5. the entity is not Daolin
6. not Daolin are all completely unique and are their own unique power/force
7. will is a function of existence. there is no motive in this being. their will is the process by which they exist. they plant because that is what they do. like a machine :)
8. matter can pop into existence in a vacuum. same concept.
9. one of the things being contended with is the cycle. is this a cycle that renews as entropy is approached like our own universe or is this a cycle that vanishes as entropy is approached?
10. the sand heartstone is more unique than just the sandstreams. based on the mechanics it appears to be gaining energy over time rather than losing it. I try to explain this in notes but didn't come up with anything i liked

Also Daolin vs not Daolin is nothing vs something and the meaningless present in both.

Daolin vs universe. The universe is the canvas by which Daolin cast their shadow (presence)

The universe is an expression of will

The heartstones are embodiments of will

Meaning is prescribed by the beings created out of the heartstones, the fountains of will.

The interaction of that meaning and will, perpetrated by those of the heartstones, grants shape to Daolin (Yeffghaner scenario) and introduces the concept of individuality.

The Daolin's presence upon the canvas is a reflection of their own volume. If Daolin are ocean then phantasms are droplets. That volume correlates with the potential for will, individuality, and the capacity to learn. Nimhdu's mimicry was a function of learning.
